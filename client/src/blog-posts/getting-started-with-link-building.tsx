      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Link building is one of the most important aspects of SEO. It involves acquiring hyperlinks from other websites 
        to your own site. Search engines use these links to crawl the web and determine how well pages should rank 
        in search results.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Link Building Matters</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        High-quality backlinks serve as "votes of confidence" from other websites. When authoritative sites link to 
        your content, search engines interpret this as a signal that your content is valuable and trustworthy.

              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Quality always beats quantity when it comes to backlinks. A few high-authority 
              links are worth more than hundreds of low-quality ones.
