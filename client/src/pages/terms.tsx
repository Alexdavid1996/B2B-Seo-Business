                The Platform provides an internal wallet for handling payments

                between users are free and do not require any payment through
                the Platform. Top-ups for guest post payments are processed via
                supported payment methods and are usually available immediately
                after confirmation. Withdrawals from your wallet are typically
                completed within a few minutes but may take up to 24 hours. It
                is the userâ€™s responsibility to ensure payment details are
                correct, as transactions cannot be reversed. Any applicable
                platform fees are shown before each transaction and deducted
                automatically.
